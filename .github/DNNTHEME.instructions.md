Each folder under /Skins represents an available DNN Theme (previously known as Skins).

This project should only be concerned with Themes named "AccuTheme-*".

DNN Themes are .NET Framework WebForms based. All markup and code is in the *.ascx
file and we do not use code behind files (*.ascx.cs).

Any files in Skins/[dnn-theme-name]/dist and the /Skin.css file are generated by
this project (build/compile) and should never be edited or changed.

The Skins/[dnn-theme-name]/menus folder is special. Each folder is the name of a
DDR Menu (usually Razor) template which is specified and configured (usually) in
the theme's /includes/header.ascx (or /partials/header.ascx).
