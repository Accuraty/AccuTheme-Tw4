# AccuTheme-Tw4

## Rules to Remember

- Don't construct class names [dynamically in your code](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files#dynamic-class-names)
- Tw compiler does NOT scan files ([verified in the docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files#which-files-are-scanned)):
  - excluded by your .gitignore
  - CSS files

## Starter for Custom Tailwind based DNN Theme

This needs to answer the questions from scratch as if somewhere in the future, the person
responsible for this website discovers that the site is using a custom theme and drilled
down to this folder and found this README.md...

- Who made this theme?
- Where can I find info on the theme template this custom theme was started from?
- How do I modify **\_**?
- What is OHS?
- etc.
