  that are not reachable by the compiler,   
  e.g. content inside an HTML Module or 2sxc Content.

    <p>This is where you explain things in detail, or included explanations the user will only need the first time they
      see and read your infos.</p>
    <p>It is probably worth reminding anyone that can see this, that its only visible to logged in users with edit or
      higher permissions.</p>
